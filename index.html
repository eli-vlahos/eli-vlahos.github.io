            Getting into the University of Waterloo for Engineering was a privilege. I am thankful to all those that helped me achieve this. <br>
            <br>
            My favorite courses were those that helped with my foundations in programming. ECE 150 helped establish strong abilities in back end programming. It taught me structured programming theorem, memory management, pointers, classes, inheritance and arrays.
            <br>
            <br>

            Three other courses I especially enjoyed were Calculus 2, Discrete Mathmatics and Economics for Engineers. The two math courses helped establish strong theoratical foundations for applications of mathmatics in finance and machine learning. 
            <!--Gradient Calculus and probability theory helped an understanding of -->
            <br>
            <br>
            Economics for Engineers taught the fundamentals of cash flow and economic analysis for annual, present and future fiscal values. I learned about the rate of return as well as cost benefit and uncertainty analysis. These provided strong fundamentals in money management for projects and investment.

            <img src="/Pics/vanier.jpg" class = "vpic">
            <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Diploma in Pure and Applied Sciences </h2>
            <p style = "text-align: center; margin-top:30px; width:90%; margin-left:40px;">
            CEGEP taught me the necessary soft skills to persevere and thrive in post-secondary education. Living in Montreal by myself while attending CEGEP helped me adjust to a more indepedent and organized lifestyle.

            <br>
            <br>
              Studying the applied sciences teaches one the necessary conceptual and numerical framework to understand the relevant scientific topics. In courses such as Wave, Optics and Modern Physics, and Mechanics, I learned the foundations for physics. General Chemistry and Chemistry of Solutions helped teach the fundamentals of the subjects' application in the modern world. Finally, Differential Equations and Linear Algebra laid the framework for practical applications of mathmatics in physics and programming. The paper on rocket motion that I wrote helped my understanding of scientific research and professionalism in the sciences.

            Besides academic activities, there were many extracurriculars to enjoy. While at Vanier I was in the Philosophy Club and on the electoral committee for the Student ASssociation elections. As a member of the electoral committee, I arranged the student elections for a voting body of 6000 youth. As Vice-President of the Philosophy Club, I organized a religious roundtable event with a representative from every Abrahamic religion. There were over forty participants in discussions that enlightened the student body on the practices of modern religion.
